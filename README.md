- Project status: [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept)
- Screencast: https://youtu.be/9oih7cZTjk4

To generate PDF instead send mails, see this project: [gibbon-pdf](https://github.com/stephane-klein/gibbon-pdf)

## Why this project?

- I would like to move transactionnal mail engine from my application in a separate service
- I would like to allow humans to send email manually, via a simple application plugged to the same API.
- I would like to keep a history (optionally) of all mail sent

## This project is based on this stack

- [Backend](backend/):
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
  - [`mjmlio/mjml`](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) to generate Html email
  - [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to fill Email templates
  - [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com) to send email
  - [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) (see [swagger.yaml](backend/src/swagger.yaml) file)
- [Frontend](frontend/)
  - [ReactJS](https://en.reactjs.org/), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  - [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) to generate Form from JSON Schema (need Bootstrap version `v3.3.6`)
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Tooling
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for backend tests

## FAQ

### How can I enable Authentication system?

This project hasn't build-in authentication system, it's a internal service in your stack,
you must protect it by a private network or [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) system.

### How does the multi-language support works?

Inside your mail templates folders, you can create multiple languages files for the same email, in the following format: `{lang}.(mjml|subject|txt)`.

You also need to let a default file in case the language is not found or no language is requested.

So, for example, your folder should look something like this:

```
$ ls mail-templates/mail-example
default.mjml       default.subject             fr.txt            de.mjml           de.subject          es.txt
default.txt        fr.mjml                     fr.subject        de.txt            es.mjml             es.subject
```

Then, you can add the `lang` property to the body of your request, which will send the email with the requested language if it exists.

For example, the following body will try to send a german email:

```
{
  "from": "no-reply@example.com",
  "to": "john.doe@example.com",
  "lang": "de"
}
```

If the `lang` property is not present in the body of your request, the default email will be sent.

### Why « Gibbon-mail » name?

[Gibbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon) as an allusion to [Mandrill App](https://mandrill.com/).

### Custom filters

All Nunjucks features and filters are available, but often enough, you may find that not to be enough. Gibbon now supports custom filters.

To learn how to do this, refer to [backend/filters/index.js](backend/filters/index.js).

### How can I keep an archive of all mails send by Gibbon-mail?

Configure `BCC` variable env as below example to send all mails send by Gibbon-mail to `log@example.com` email account.

```
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  gibbon-mail:
    image: stephaneklein/gibbon-mail:latest
    ports:
     - 5000:5000
    volumes:
     - ../mail-templates/:/templates/
    environment:
      SMTP_USERNAME: user
      SMTP_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP_HOST: mailcatcher
      SMTP_PORT: 1025
      BCC: log@example.com,test1@example.com
```

Or you can pass it to the body of the request as `bcc`.

### Why can I configure two smtp service?

Gibbon-mail support two smtp server configuration, for instance:

```
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  gibbon-mail:
    image: stephaneklein/gibbon-mail:latest
    ports:
     - 5000:5000
    volumes:
     - ../mail-templates/:/templates/
    environment:
      SMTP_USERNAME: user
      SMTP_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP_HOST: mailcatcher
      SMTP_PORT: 1025
      SMTP_LABEL: "Send mail to Mailcatcher"
      SMTP2_USERNAME: user
      SMTP2_PASSWORD: password
      SMTP2_HOST: example.com
      SMTP2_PORT: 25
      SMTP2_LABEL: "Send mail with example.com smtp server"
      BCC: log@example.com
```

You can use `SMTP2_URL` for instance on staging environment: by default, you send mail to Mailhog fake smtp server et optionnaly on real smtp server to test your mail template rendering on several email clients.
